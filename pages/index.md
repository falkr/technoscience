# Research Methodology for Technology

:abstract: The scientific method ensures the quality of knowledge acquired in research and is the basis for the natural sciences that explore the world.
Technology involves research that aims to create artifacts that solve
or improve a specific problem in the world, and which try to change it.
The goal of this seminar is to provide an overview of the most important
concepts of research methods for technology for students that start with their thesis, and serve as an introduction for own learning afterwards.

## Learning Goals of this Seminar


:goals: After successfully going through this seminar, you will be able to:

  - Understand the difference between the scientific process for natural sciences and a scientific process for science that deals with technology, be able to explain this difference to others, and reflect about the significance for your thesis.
  - Distinguish between knowledge questions and design problems, and identify them in the context of your thesis.
  - Recite all tasks part of the design cycle to create new artifacts.

With respect to your thesis, these skills will enable you to:

  - Write a better problem statement for your thesis.
  - Write a better research plan for your thesis.
  - Understand the difference between what you do in your thesis and what you write about, and what the contribution of your thesis is.
  - Be more aware of the important work you need to conduct in order to
produce results.
  - Reflect better about your work in general.
  
  
:aside: Come back to these learning goals after the entire seminar and check if you have reached them.


## Learning Plan

This seminar is divided in three parts, following the method of
team-based learning that you may already be familiar with.

    through on your own.

2.  There will be a readiness assurance test on this material at the
