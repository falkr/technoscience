# Class Time

:abstract: These notes are the backbone of the seminar with exercises and
additional material. You are welcome to take a look and read ahead, 
but not all information is self-contained or complete.

# Activity 1: What is Knowledge?

**Step 1:** (Individual) Come up with a good definition for what
constitutes valuable knowledge:

**Step 2:** (In Team, on the whiteboard.) Discuss your solutions, and
merge them together to an improved version that covers the most
important aspects.

**Conclusion:** Make notes from the conclusion in class. What
constitutes knowledge?

# Scaling Up: Validation

We have learned that a full evaluation is often not feasible. Instead, a
validation tries to *"justify that a treatment would contribute to
stakeholder goals if implemented"* and *"The goal of validation is to
predict how an artifact will interact with its context, without actually
observing an implemented artifact in a real-world context."*

Usually, a validation is done in an lab or under lab conditions, i.e.,
is not realistic. Therefore the idea of **scaling up** is interesting.

# Design Cycle and Empirical Cycle

The design cycle that we already covered in the preparation is used to
solve design problems.

Analogously, there is a cycle to answer knowledge questions, and it is
called the empirical cycle. Since its detailed content is highly
dependent on your specific work area, we cannot cover it in detail here
in this seminar.

The illustration below illustrates how design cycle and empirical cycle
can fit together in a thesis: The spiral in the center are the
iterations of the design cycle. They trigger knowledge questions, for
instance to understand the problem context, answer questions about an
artifact, or perform a validation. Whenever that happens, the design
cycle triggers iterations of empirical cycles. (Don't take this
illustration too literally. It is an illustration, not a fixed
instruction.)

**Conclusion:** What should a thesis cover, with regard to design cycles
and empirical cycles?

# Design Science for Your Thesis

With what you know by now, you should be able to outline the big picture
of your thesis with regard to design science. The scheme on the next
page should guide you through this process and stimulate important
questions you should be aware of.

There are three areas in the scheme:

-   **Social context:** This describes a part of the world as it is, and
    consists of the stakeholders who want a specific problem solved, and
    who have specific goals. They may not know the problem and the goal,
    and it may be part of research to formulate them.

-   **Research:** This is the part of the project that you control. It
    consists of **Design** (the creation of artifacts) and their
    **Investigation** (answering knowledge questions about the design).

-   **Knowledge context:** This is the existing knowledge about the
    world, including existing designs. Your research will also result in
    new knowledge and new designs.

Instructions:

-   Think of your master thesis topic, and fill out the different fields
    (3 in Social Context, 3 in Knowledge Context, 4 in Your Research).

-   Iterate over all of them, fill in the ones you are most confident of
    first.

-   If you are stuck on one point, move to the next. Try rather to cover
    the entire diagram than to fine-tune individual points. Try to get
    the big picture right.

# Steps Forward

This seminar is only the beginning of your work with your thesis.
You got an introduction to some of the questions and taxonomy so that you are able to start asking the right questions and reading more on methodology. We propose the following steps forward:

---
type: figure
source: figures/process.png
caption: "Proposed steps forward from this seminar to your thesis."
---

1. Start thinking about your detailed thesis topic. 
2. Start thinking about the method you need. (This is where we are now.)
3. Apply what you learned about methodology to your specific topic, for instance by filling out the design science scheme from above.
4. Read more about methodology, for instance with the books recommended below or other material. 
5. While iterating through steps 3 and 4, also start planning for your thesis and write down the plan.

Do all of this in collaboration with your supervisors, and show them your plan. They may have valuable input, but remember that planning for the thesis is your own responsibility.


## Recommended Books

There are two specific books that we recommend for further work.

* Roel Wieringa: **Design Science Methodology**. (English). This book is accessible as PDF when you follow [this link to Springer via the campus network](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-662-43839-8).
* Ketil Stølen: **Teknologivitenskap**. (Norwegian). This book is available from [Universitetsforlaget](https://www.universitetsforlaget.no/teknologivitenskap).



# Final Tips

-   Focus on the thesis on providing valuable knowledge, then design
    science will fit in as a tool for guiding you.

-   You need to think for yourself. Design science is a framework that
    provides you guidelines for how to ask relevant questions, but not
    how to answer them for your specific project.
    The answer how you should apply to your specific topic is an answer that only you can find.

-   Guidance on methods, experiments, validation and overall scope are
    valuable discussion subjects for you and your supervisor. Talk with
    your supervisor about these issues!

-   Read the chapters of the book on design science that are relevant
    for you.
