## Question 1

:rat:Which of the following is the best definition of design science?

1. Design science is a scientific method for engineers.
2. Design science is the design and investigation of artifacts in context.
3. Design science is the design and investigation of interactions between artifacts and their context.
4. Design science is the scientific investigation of anything designed by humans.

## Question 2

:rat:What is a difference between the natural science and design science?

1. Design science is for engineers, natural science for scientists.
2. Natural science does not cover implementation.
3. Design science explores technology as if it was a natural phenomena.
4. Design science aims to change the world, natural science tries to understand it.

## Question 3

:rat:Which of the following is not an artifact as defined by design science?

1. An electron
2. A Python program
3. An electric circuit
4. A standard for electromagnetic protection of electronic circuits

## Question 4

:rat:What is the difference between the engineering cycle and the design cycle?

1. The engineering cycle also includes the actual implementation of the artifact in the real world.
2. The engineering cycle has the same steps as the design cycle, but with less scientific rigor.
3. The design cycle aims at evaluating an artifact in context.
4. The design cycle extends the engineering cycle.

## Question 5

:rat:In the framework of design science, what is another term for *treatment*?

1. result
2. system implementation
3. solution
4. artifact

## Question 6

:rat:What is the difference between __evaluation__ and __validation__?

1. They only differ in extend and effort spent. Evaluation is more elaborate than validation.
2. Evaluation requires that we observe the artifact in its real-world context, the validation does not.
3. Evaluation is the design-science equivalent to what validation is in natural science.
4. Evaluation includes the implementation phase, validation does not.

## Question 7

:rat:

1. Design problems have a single artifact as result.
2. Design problems are evaluated by truth.
3. Knowledge questions are evaluated by the utility to the stakeholder.
4. Knowledge questions have a single answer.
