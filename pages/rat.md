## Question 1

:rat:Which of the following is the best definition of a research methodology for technology?

1. The scientific investigation of anything designed by humans.
2. A scientific method for engineers.
3. The design and investigation of artifacts in context.
4. The design and investigation of interactions between artifacts and their context.

## Question 2

:rat:What is a difference between natural science and research within technology?

1. Natural science does not cover implementation.
2. Scientific research explores technology as if it was a natural phenomena.
3. Technology aims to change the world, natural science tries to understand it.
4. Technology is for engineers, natural science for scientists.

## Question 3

:rat:Which of the following is not an artifact as defined in the preparation?

1. An electric circuit
2. A standard for electromagnetic protection of electronic circuits
3. An electron
4. A Python program

## Question 4

:rat:What is the difference between the engineering cycle and the design cycle?

1. The design cycle extends the engineering cycle.
2. The engineering cycle also includes the actual implementation of the artifact in the real world.
3. The engineering cycle has the same steps as the design cycle, but with less scientific rigor.
4. The design cycle aims at evaluating an artifact in context.

## Question 5

:rat:What is another term for *treatment*?

1. result
2. system implementation
3. solution
4. artifact

## Question 6

:rat:What is the difference between _evaluation_ and _validation_?

1. Evaluation is the design-science equivalent to what validation is in natural science.
2. Evaluation includes the implementation phase, validation does not.
3. They only differ in extend and effort spent. Evaluation is more elaborate than validation.
4. Evaluation requires that we observe the artifact in its real-world context, the validation does not.

## Question 7

:rat:

1. Knowledge questions are evaluated by the utility to the stakeholder.
2. Knowledge questions have a single answer.
3. Design problems have a single artifact as result.
4. Design problems are evaluated by truth.
